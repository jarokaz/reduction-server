    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to optimize large distributed training Vertex AI jobs using Reduction Server. \n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning task in this example is fine tuning a BERT model for sentence prediction using  the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Corpus (MNLI) from the GLUE benchmark. \n",
    "\n",
    "The example uses components from [TensorFlow NLP Modelling Toolkit](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/nlp#tensorflow-nlp-modelling-toolkit) and distributed training is implemented using [tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy). \n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to configure, submit and monitor a Vertex AI custom training job that uses Reduction Server to optimize network bandwith and latency of the gradient reduction operation in the distributed training setting.  \n",

    "The steps performed include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Building a custom training container image based on TensorFlow NLP Modelling Toolkit\n",
    "- Converting the glue/mnli dataset to the format required by TensorFlow NLP Modelling Toolkit\n",
    "- Preparing a Vertex AI custom container training job that uses Reduction Server\n",

    "\n",
    "When choosing the number and type of reducers, you should consider the network bandwidth supported by a reducer replica’s machine type. In GCP, a VM’s machine type defines its maximum possible egress bandwidth. For example, the egress bandwidth of the n1-highcpu-16 machine type is limited at 32 Gbps.\n",

    "Because reducers perform a very limited function, aggregating blocks of gradients, they can run on relatively low-powered and cost effective machines. Even with a large number of gradients this computation does not require accelerated hardware or high CPU or memory resources. However, to avoid network bottlenecks, the total aggregate bandwidth of all replicas in the reducer worker pool must be greater or equal to the total aggregate bandwidth of all replicas in worker pools 0 and 1, which host the GPU workers.\n",
