    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to optimize large distributed training Vertex AI jobs using Reduction Server. \n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning task in this example is fine tuning a BERT model for sentence prediction using  the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Corpus (MNLI) from the GLUE benchmark. \n",
    "\n",
    "The example uses components from [TensorFlow NLP Modelling Toolkit](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/nlp#tensorflow-nlp-modelling-toolkit) and distributed training is implemented using [tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy). \n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to configure, submit and monitor a Vertex AI custom training job that uses Reduction Server to optimize network bandwith and latency of the gradient reduction operation in the distributed training setting.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- Building a custom training container image based on TensorFlow NLP Modelling Toolkit\n",
